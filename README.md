A boilerplate to transpile a TypeScript project so it can run on a node environment. With an example project to showcase a friend of mine the basics of TypeScript.


Requirements:
 - Editor (Best experienced with Visual Studio Code.)
 - NodeJs and NPM installed on your local machine


This is build configuration for the server.

First install all required npm packages by opening a terminal at the root of this project and type "npm install"

To build, type: "npm run build" in the terminal

To run, type "npm run run" in the terminal
